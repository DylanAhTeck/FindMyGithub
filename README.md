# FindMyGithub

## Description

This app allows you to find Github profiles easily. At the moment, the search bar in Github is not optimized for users. Typing in a friend's full name in the search bar doesn't bring up their Profile (it favours repositories). Furthermore, the profile pictures are small and are not easily identifiable. 

This app solves this problem by creating a full-screen and aesthetic web-page to find other Github profiles. It uses the Context API along with the useContext and useReducer hooks for state management.
